Ramsurf

Ramsurf is a parabolic equation code originally developped by Dr. David C.
Calvo. It simulates underwater sound propagation.

It takes a ``ram.in`` file as input and generates two files ``tl.grid`` (resp.
``tl.line``) that represent the acoustic pressure on every water column (resp.
at the sensor depth).
