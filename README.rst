=====================
Compilation Challenge
=====================


What is it?
-----------

A few compilation challenges in the form of a source code and a typical use
case. One must modify the source to make it run as fast as possible!

How to play?
------------

Simply pick a directory, run::

    make

to build the application, and::

    make bench

to get your mark.

Then hack the code, run::

    make check
    
to be sure your modifications are correct, then bench again and so on until
exhaustion!

When you're done, submit a Pull Request or update your latest pull request on
this very repository and your code will be automagically benchmarked.

Results
-------

Results are constantly updated and and roughly formated on

challenge duration.
